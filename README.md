# Ohlone Code Good
This repository contains material from the 2021 Ohlone College Code Good workshop. Students in the workshop had a wide range of backgrounds in both math and CS, with some students indicating that they had never coded before.
## Day One
### Lecture
> Introduced various settings where code has been used for "good". Had students research one topic and present an overview to the class. Related files are `CodeGood_DayOne.key` which is the keynote presentation containing links to all the projects. 
### At-home Exercise
> Students learned how to use and set-up jupyter notebooks with the `Jupyter_Tutorial.ipynb` notebook.
> Students were introduced to matrices and the `numpy` and `networkx` libraries in the `First_Exercise.ipynb` notebook.
## Day Two
### Lecture
> Introduction to graph theory and social networks in the `Graph_Theory.ipynb` notebook.
> Introduction to visualising networks using `networkx` in the `Visualizing_Networks.ipynb` notebook.
### At-home Exercise
> Exploration of adjacency matrices and social networks in the context of contact tracing in the `Second_Exercise.ipynb` notebook.
## Day Three
### Lecture
> Students were taught a few basic tools implemented in `networkx` to analyze networks and their social implications in the `Analyzing_Networks.ipynb` notebook.
### At-home Exercise
> Teams were given a unique network dataset and asked to interpret and analyze it using the tools we've used in class. The template they were given was `Final_Project.ipynb`.
