    "## Graph Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get too into networks, we'll first discuss the object called a _**graph**_. A graph is an object that specifies relationships amongst a collection of items. A graph is made up of objects called _**nodes**_ (or vertices) which are connected by _**edges**_. In the above example each person is a _**node**_ and the string signifying a friendship is an _**edge**_. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a graph, two nodes are _**neighbors**_ if there is an edge connecting them. A typical way to view a graph is with circles and lines: each circle represents a node and lines represent edges between them\n",

   "source": [
    "A graph can either be _**directed**_ or _**undirected**_. Undirected graphs represent _symmetric_ relationships between nodes, that is, relationships that are (or are assumed to be) reciprocated. For example, in the social network example, it wouldn't be necessary for me to give Shivani one end of one of my strings if she had already given me one end of hers... her knowing me implies that I am friends with her. We would call the edges in an undirected graph _undirected edges_. However, if we had instead formed the network by saying, \"Give one end of a string to everybody that _you texted_ last week\" then the relationships might be _asymmetric_. What if Shivani texted me but I had forgotten to reply? We would call the edges in a directed graph _directed edges_."

    "#### Why do you think there need to be both directed and undirected graphs? \n",
    "What kind of information do you think would be missing if a graph was assumed to be undirected if it actually wasn't? Think about what you might learn about a group of classmates if they were asked about friendships or romantic relationships. Wouldn't it be interesting to know if an edge was directed or not? \n",
    "#### Self loops\n",
    "When a node has an edge connecting it to itself, the edge is called a \"self-loop\". Can you think of an example of a graph where self loops would make sense?\n",

    "Because graphs are objects which describe relationships between things, they are the perfect way to represent a network (in fact, they are so perfect that I might accidentally use the two words interchangeably). \n",
    "\n",
    "Althought we've introduced the main components of graphs with the _social network_ example above, remember that graphs indicate _any_ relationship between _any_ types of objects--not just social ties between humans! Below are some more examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The BART train map** Nodes are the BART stops and the BART lines that go between the stops as edges. This is an example of a _transportation network_.\n",
    "* **Prerequesites for courses** Nodes are the courses and the _directed_ edges are the dependencies: an edge from CS100 to CS102 means you must take CS100 before CS102. This is an example of a _dependency network_.\n",
    "* **Bridges** Joints are nodes and physical bars are edges. This is an example of a _structural network_.\n",
    "* **Web Links** Websites are nodes and links from one website to another are edges. \n",

This is because there is no such path between any pink node and any light blue node, nor between any pink node and the green node, nor between the green node and any light blue node! When a graph is not connected it has more than one _**component**_. A _**connected component**_ (also called just a component) of a graph is a subset of the nodes such that there is (i) a path between every pair of nodes in the subset and (ii) the subset is not part of some larger set wherein every node has a path to every other. \n",
